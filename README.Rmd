This repository is part of the "Positive Result Rate in Kinesiology" project. Including in this repository our sub-folders of a variety of analyses. In the main folder, I have included a number of summary documents.

1. *Bayesian_Power_Analysis.pdf* - A document that provides the justification of our sample size for this study

2. *Pilot_Analyses.html* - A short document demonstrating, or at least explaining all of our planned analyses for the study by using pilot data as an example.
